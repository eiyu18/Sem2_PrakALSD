# Labs #1 Array Of Objects

## 1.2 Create, insert, and display Array of Object

The solution is implemented in Rectangle10.java & ArrayObjects.java, and below is screenshot of the result.

**Brief explanaton:** There are 4 main step: 
1. Declare the two variables for width and height.
2. Make array of the Rectangle Class.
3. Input values of each Array's attributes.
4. Print the array
**Question**
1. The class only have the attributes not the methods
2.  The Rectangle class does not have an explicit constructor, The default constructor allows instantiation with default values new Rectangle()
3.  This line declares and initializes an array named rectangleArray that can store three Rectangle objects.
4.  Instantiate a Rectangle object of the rectangleArray and values to its length and width attributes.
5.  Makes the code easier to maintain, reuse, and test.

## 1.3 Input data into Array of Objects using Loops

The solution is implemented in Rectangle10.java & ArrayObjects.java, and below is screenshot of the result.

**Brief explanaton:** There are 4 main step: 
1. Input the length and with
2. Loop a length and width process to input a value for each array
3. Print
**Question**
1. Yes, an array of objects can be implemented in a 2D array.
2. The rows of the array can represent the width of the rectangle, and the columns can represent the length of the rectangle.
3. Because the square object at index 5 is not intantiated.

5. we can duplicate the instantiation but it will overwrites the previous reference leading to data loss.
