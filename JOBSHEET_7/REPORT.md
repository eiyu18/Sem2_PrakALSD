##Question 
1. showPosition() displays the index position in the array where the student with the given NIM was found mean while showData() displays the complete student information (NIM, name, age, GPA) if the student is found.
2. The break statement is used to exit the loop as soon as the desired NIM is found
3. No error, and the result will still be correct simply because sequential search checks each element one by one regardless of order.
4. -1 is used to indicate that the data was not found because If it were 0, and the data was not in the list.
